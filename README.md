Live version can be seen on [Heroku](Link coming soon). The app sleeps on a free server so you may need to wait a couple of seconds for it to wake up.

The app has been developed by Piotr Berebecki as part of undertaking an excellent course: [React for Beginners](https://learnredux.com/) by Wes Bos.

The technologies used include:

* React
* ES6
* Node
* Gulp
* Browserify
* Express
* Karma
* Mocha
* Firebase
* OAuth
* Git
* GitHub
